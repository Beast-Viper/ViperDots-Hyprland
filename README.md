# My Hyprland Setup

This repository contains my personal configuration files for Hyprland, a dynamic tiling window manager for Linux. I've aimed for a clean, minimalistic setup, perfect for those who appreciate efficiency and a distraction-free workspace. Plus, Iâ€™m using **GNU Stow** to keep everything tidy with symlinks.

## Installation

Setting up this configuration is a breeze! Just follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beast-Viper/ViperDots-Hyprland.git ~/ViperDots-Hyprland

2. **Navigate to the dotfiles directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/ViperDots-Hyprland

3. **Install Dependencies (Choose ONE method):**

   This step installs all the necessary programs.  Pick the method that suits your distro:

   a) **AUR Helper (paru or yay - Arch Linux):**

     ```bash
     paru -S avizo btop blueman bluez bluez-utils brightnessctl conky easyeffects fastfetch fish hyprland hyprlock hypridle hyprsunset kitty nautilus network-manager-applet nvim nwglook pactl pavucontrol qt5ct qt6ct swaync swww waybar wlogout
     ```

   b) **pacman (Arch Linux):**

     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S avizo btop blueman bluez bluez-utils brightnessctl conky easyeffects fastfetch fish hyprland hyprlock hypridle hyprsunset kitty nautilus network-manager-applet nwglook nvim pactl pavucontrol qt5ct qt6ct swaync swww waybar wlogout
     ```

   c) **Your Distribution's Package Manager:**
     Adapt the commands above to your package manager (apt, dnf, zypper, etc.).  You'll need to find the correct package names for your distro.

4. **Run the install script:**
   
   IMPORTANT: Make sure you are not logged into Hyprland before running the script else script will fail.

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh          #Make it executable

   ./install.sh                 #Run the script


## Usage
  You can kick off Hyprland with any display manager, but I recommend SDDM for the best experience.

Want to see all the keybinds? Just hit Super + / and youâ€™re good to go!

Feel free to dive in, customize, and make it your own! Happy tinkering! ðŸŽ‰

A lot of the basics are inspired by https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots , but Iâ€™ve put my own minimalistic spin on things.

## Screenshots

Hereâ€™s a peek at my setup:

## Customization

Feel free to tweak any of the configurations to fit your style! Iâ€™ve set things up to be as minimal as possible, but thereâ€™s always room for personal flair. 

~/.config/hypr contains most hyprland configs such as hyprland.conf, hypridle.conf, hyprlock.conf and many more.

You can also find separate files for individual things such as animations, keybinds and others.

GTK3/4 theme is a personal catppuccin-like modified version using https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme as base.
